# UnityDllHandling
This is just a sample project for working with managed and native DLLs in a Unity Project.

It includes the VS native DLL solution, VS managed DLL solution and the Unity project integrating the resulting DLLs.

I intend to continue constructing this repository based on what I identify necessary for understanding how to work with DLLs in Unity.
